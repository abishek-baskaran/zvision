# ZVision Backend Refactoring Log

## Phase 1: Project Structure Refactor and Setup (Completed)

**Goal**: Establish the new module structure without changing functionality yet. Prepare the ground for parallel processes.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Created New Module Files:

- **app/camera_manager.py**
  - Created `CameraWorker` class to manage single camera source
  - Created `CameraManager` class with a singleton instance to manage multiple cameras
  - Simplified camera access via shared interface
  - Prepared for future multiprocessing implementation

- **app/detection_worker.py**
  - Created `DetectionWorker` to encapsulate detection logic
  - Created `DetectionManager` with a singleton instance 
  - Currently wraps the existing YOLO detection function
  - Structure ready for future parallel processing implementation

- **app/analytics.py**
  - Created metrics tracking for:
    - Frame processing rates (FPS)
    - Detection counts
    - Inference latency
    - Camera status monitoring
  - Thread-safe implementation with locking mechanisms
  - History tracking with configurable buffer sizes

#### 2. Modified Existing Services:

- **app/services/detection_service.py**
  - Updated `detect_all_people()` to use the new camera_manager
  - Added performance monitoring using analytics module
  - Maintained API compatibility for all endpoints

#### 3. Updated FastAPI Routes:

- **app/routes/camera.py**
  - Modified camera snapshot endpoint to use camera_manager
  - Removed direct OpenCV calls in favor of the manager interface
  - Maintained API compatibility

- **app/routes/detection.py**
  - Updated image detection endpoint to use detection_manager
  - Added timing and analytics tracking
  - Maintained API compatibility

#### 4. Added Application Lifecycle Management:

- **main.py**
  - Added startup event to initialize services
  - Added shutdown event for proper resource cleanup
  - Imported new singleton instances

### Verification against Plan Requirements:

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Create module skeletons | ✅ Complete | Created camera_manager.py, detection_worker.py, analytics.py with basic classes and docstrings |
| Define basic classes | ✅ Complete | Implemented CameraWorker, CameraManager, DetectionWorker, DetectionManager, Analytics |
| Move relevant constants/functions | ✅ Complete | Imported run_yolo_inference from app/inference/detection.py |
| Integrate modules into FastAPI | ✅ Complete | Added imports and startup/shutdown events in main.py |
| Maintain API endpoints | ✅ Complete | All existing endpoints still work with the same interface |

### Next Steps:

Phase 2 will focus on:
- Moving camera capture into a separate process
- Creating a continuous frame capture loop
- Implementing shared memory for efficient frame access

### Status:
- All planned Phase 1 tasks complete
- System ready for Phase 2 implementation 

## Phase 5: Code Cleanup and Archive (Completed)

**Goal**: Clean up the codebase by archiving obsolete files from the original implementation, maintaining a clean project structure while preserving historical code.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Created Archive Directory Structure:

- Created organized archive folders:
  - app/archive/inference
  - app/archive/services
  - app/archive/webrtc
  - app/archive/routes
  - app/archive/tests
  - app/archive/temp
  - app/archive/main

#### 2. Moved Obsolete Files to Archive:

- **Inference Files:**
  - Moved app/inference/detection.py to archive
  - Moved app/inference/pipeline.py to archive

- **WebRTC Files:**
  - Moved app/webrtc/mock_camera.py to archive
  - Saved app/webrtc/frame_extractor.py.original to archive

- **Routes Files:**
  - Saved app/routes/camera.py.original to archive
  - Saved app/routes/detection.py.original to archive

- **Temporary Files:**
  - Moved all files from app/temp/* to archive

#### 3. Documentation:

- Created ARCHIVE_README.md in refactor_plan folder
- Documented archive structure, file purposes, and refactoring context
- Added notes about accessing archived code for reference

### Verification against Project Requirements:

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Archive obsolete files | ✅ Complete | All identified obsolete files moved to organized archive structure |
| Maintain original structure | ✅ Complete | Archive directory mirrors original project structure |
| Document archived files | ✅ Complete | Created comprehensive documentation in ARCHIVE_README.md |
| Preserve project history | ✅ Complete | All original code preserved for reference |

### Final Project Status:

- ✅ Phase 1: Project structure refactored
- ✅ Phase 2: Camera capture moved to separate process
- ✅ Phase 3: Detection implemented in parallel processes
- ✅ Phase 4: Metrics and analytics added
- ✅ Phase 5: Codebase cleaned up and archived

The ZVision backend has been successfully refactored with an improved architecture featuring:
- Multiprocessing for camera capture and detection
- Efficient frame sharing through queues
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Clean, maintainable codebase structure

The system is now ready for production use with improved performance, reliability, and maintainability.

## Main Application Refactoring

### Changes Made to main.py:

1. **Updated Imports**
   - Added StreamingResponse from fastapi.responses
   - Removed obsolete route imports (logs, events, calibration, etc.)
   - Kept only core routes: camera, detection, metrics

2. **Service Management**
   - Added proper initialization sequence in startup event
   - Enhanced shutdown process with better error handling
   - Added service status reporting to /api/ping endpoint

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added try/catch blocks for startup and shutdown
   - Improved error messages and logging
   - Added graceful process termination

4. **Configuration**
   - Updated version to 2.0.0 to reflect refactor
   - Set single worker mode for proper process management
   - Enhanced development environment placeholder

5. **Code Organization**
   - Cleaned up comments and documentation
   - Improved code structure and readability
   - Added proper type hints and docstrings

### Verification:

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Core services initialization | ✅ Complete | Analytics, camera, and detection managers properly initialized |
| Error handling | ✅ Complete | Added comprehensive error handling for startup/shutdown |
| Process management | ✅ Complete | Single worker mode, proper cleanup of child processes |
| API compatibility | ✅ Complete | Maintained compatibility with frontend |
| Development support | ✅ Complete | Enhanced development environment and debugging |

### Status:
- Main application refactored to support new architecture
- All core services properly managed
- Clean startup and shutdown processes
- Ready for production deployment
