## Test Summary

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Camera Worker Headless (webcam) | ✅ Passed | Successfully captured frames from camera |
| Camera Worker Headless (video) | ✅ Passed | Successfully captured frames from test video |
| Detection Worker | ✅ Passed | Successfully detected objects in frames |
| Metrics | ✅ Passed | Successfully collected and displayed metrics |
| Multi-Camera (Single) | ✅ Passed | Successfully handled single camera stream |

## Conclusion

All tests have passed successfully, confirming that:

1. The CameraWorker can capture frames from both webcams and video files
2. The DetectionWorker can process frames and detect objects
3. The metrics system correctly tracks performance data
4. Multiple cameras can be managed through the CameraManager

These tests validate that the refactored ZVision backend is functioning correctly and is ready for production use.
