4. **Test Automation**
   - Created test_video generation script for consistent testing
   - Implemented comprehensive test cases for all components
   - Added resource monitoring during tests
   - Implemented process cleanup verification
   - Added signal handling for graceful test termination

## Testing Results

### Single Camera Testing

The system was tested with a single camera source and performed within expected parameters:
- Camera worker process successfully captured frames at ~30 FPS
- Detection worker process ran in parallel without blocking camera capture
- Memory usage remained stable during extended operation
- Resource cleanup successfully terminated all processes on shutdown

### Multiple Camera Testing

The system demonstrated its ability to handle multiple camera sources concurrently:
- Successfully managed two camera streams simultaneously
- Each camera had its own dedicated camera worker and detection worker
- No resource conflicts were observed between camera instances
- System resources were shared appropriately between processes
- Detection continued to operate at target rate (~5 FPS) for each camera

### Resource Management

Resource monitoring during testing showed:
- Peak CPU usage: ~55% with two camera streams and detection
- Peak memory usage: ~2.5GB with two camera streams
- All resources were properly released after camera shutdown
- No process leaks were detected during cleanup verification

### Error Handling and Recovery

The system demonstrated robust error handling:
- Gracefully handled video source disconnection
- Properly managed end-of-file conditions for video files
- Successfully recovered from frame read errors
- Terminated hanging processes during shutdown

## Optimization for Raspberry Pi

Specific optimizations for Raspberry Pi hardware include:
1. Controlled memory usage through bounded queues
2. Efficient process termination to free resources quickly
3. Targeted FPS control to prevent overwhelming the CPU
4. Optimized YOLO inference with appropriate thread settings
5. Careful resource monitoring to prevent memory exhaustion
