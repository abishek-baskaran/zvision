1. Set a Compatible Start Method
Goal: Use a start method that avoids fork-related issues on Python 3.12+.

Prompt:

Open your main entry file (where if __name__ == "__main__": logic resides) or a top-level initialization file.

Add:

python
Copy
Edit
import multiprocessing
if name == "main": multiprocessing.set_start_method("spawn")

markdown
Copy
Edit
3. Restart the application.  
4. Check if the error persists.  

**Note**: `spawn` avoids copying the entire parent process memory (and objects like `weakref`) into the child process, which can fix many pickling issues.
2. Ensure the CameraWorker Class Is Top-Level and Pickle-Friendly
Goal: Eliminate references to unpicklable objects (e.g., Starlette/ FastAPI objects) inside the worker’s constructor or attributes.

Prompt:

In camera_manager.py (or wherever CameraWorker is defined), confirm that:

The CameraWorker class is defined at the top level (not nested in another function/class).

It does not capture references to FastAPI/Starlette Request objects, dependencies, or any objects containing weakref references.

Example fix:

python
Copy
Edit
class CameraWorker(multiprocessing.Process):
    def __init__(self, camera_id: str, camera_source: str, some_config: dict):
        super().__init__()
        self.camera_id = camera_id
        self.camera_source = camera_source
        self.some_config = some_config
        # Avoid storing the entire FastAPI application or request objects here
    
    def run(self):
        # Worker logic (OpenCV capture, etc.)
        pass
If you need access to certain config or environment variables, store them in simple types (int, str, dict, etc.) that are picklable.

Remove or refactor any attributes that aren’t picklable. For instance:

python
Copy
Edit
# BAD: self.app = fastapi.FastAPI() or self.request = Request
# BAD: self.some_db_client = ... 
# Instead, re-initialize or connect inside run() if needed.
3. Avoid Passing Starlette Objects to Multiprocessing
Goal: Confirm route handlers do not pass unpicklable objects (like Request) into the CameraWorker.

Prompt:

In your route handler (e.g., add_camera_direct), verify that the call to camera_manager.get_camera(...) or camera_worker.start() only includes basic data (e.g., camera ID, source URL).

If you’re inadvertently passing request: Request or other Starlette objects into the worker, remove them:

python
Copy
Edit
# Instead of passing request or user object:
camera_manager.get_camera(camera_id, source_url, user=request.user)
# -> Pass only user_id (str) or user info in a dict if absolutely needed:
camera_manager.get_camera(camera_id, source_url, user_id=request.user.id)
Keep concurrency logic separate from web framework references.

4. Confirm You’re Not Storing WeakRefs in CameraManager
Goal: Weaken references that can’t be pickled or remove them altogether.

Prompt:

In camera_manager.py, check for any usage of weakref or references that might be ephemeral.

If it’s necessary (e.g., for caching), consider a different approach when using multiprocessing, or store such references only in the main process.

Alternatively, store a basic ID or dictionary that can be pickled, then re-obtain any required objects in the child process.

5. Test and Validate
Goal: Confirm the fix.

Prompt:

After making the above changes, restart your FastAPI server (with spawn mode if on Linux).

Retry the failing endpoint that triggers camera_manager.get_camera(...).

If no TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object occurs, the fix is successful.

Re-run your test suite (e.g. test_camera_worker, test_detection_worker) to confirm everything is working across the board.

Why This Works
spawn: On many Linux distros, Python’s default method is fork, which copies the entire parent process memory, including unpicklable references. spawn starts a fresh Python interpreter process and imports the modules, so you only pass picklable arguments explicitly.

Top-Level Classes: Multiprocessing uses pickle to transfer objects to child processes. Python’s pickle can only serialize classes/functions if they’re at the top level of a module. Nested or dynamically created classes can’t be pickled reliably.

No Framework Objects: FastAPI/Starlette objects often maintain weakref references, websockets, or event loops, none of which can be safely pickled.

Following these steps should resolve the TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object and allow your camera worker process to start successfully in your refactored ZVision application.
