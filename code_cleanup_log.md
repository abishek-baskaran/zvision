# ZVision Code Cleanup Log

## Analysis of Current Usage

Based on the terminal logs provided, the following endpoints are actively being used:

1. `POST /api/detect?camera_id=1` - Frequently called endpoint for on-demand detection
2. `POST /api/detection/config` - Configuration endpoint for detection settings

## Deprecated Components

The codebase contains several deprecated components that were created during the development evolution from WebSocket to WebRTC implementations.

### Deprecated Routes:
- WebSocket routes (`/api/ws/*`) - Replaced by WebRTC implementation
- WebRTC detection routes with redundant functionality

### Deprecated Files:
Files in `app/temp/archive/` and `app/temp/video_test/` directories are primarily test implementations and deprecated code.

## Cleanup Plan

1. Review and update the main API routes in `app/routes/` to keep only actively used endpoints
2. Remove WebSocket implementation which has been replaced by WebRTC
3. Clean up redundant WebRTC implementation files
4. Remove unused test files from temp directories
5. Update main.py to include only necessary routers

## Implementation Details

The current implementation uses:
- `POST /api/detect?camera_id=1` for on-demand detection
- `POST /api/detection/config` for configuring detection behavior
- WebRTC for video streaming (active implementation)

Cleaning up will focus on preserving this functionality while removing deprecated code.

## Cleanup Actions

### 1. Removed WebSocket Implementation from main.py (Completed)

- Removed the `websockets` import from main.py 
- Removed the WebSocket router registration line:
  ```python
  app.include_router(websockets.router, prefix="/api", tags=["websockets"])
  ```
- This prevents the WebSocket routes from being exposed via the API

The WebSocket implementation has been removed from the application's route registrations. This ensures that the deprecated WebSocket endpoints are no longer accessible, while maintaining the actively used detection endpoints and WebRTC functionality.

### 2. Moved Deprecated WebSocket Code to Archive (Completed)

- Created an archive directory for route files:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p app/temp/archive/routes
  ```
- Moved the WebSocket implementation to the archive:
  ```bash
  mv app/routes/websockets.py app/temp/archive/routes/
  ```

This preserves the WebSocket code for reference while removing it from the active codebase. The WebRTC implementation is now the only streaming solution in the active routes.

### 3. Fixed References to WebSocket Code (Completed)

- Identified that the WebRTC implementation was importing the `verify_token` function from the websockets module
- Moved the `verify_token` function directly into the WebRTC implementation:
  ```python
  # Copy the verify_token function from websockets.py
  async def verify_token(token: str) -> Optional[dict]:
      """Verify JWT token for WebSocket authentication"""
      try:
          payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
          username: str = payload.get("sub")
          is_admin: bool = payload.get("admin", False)
          
          if username is None:
              return None
              
          return {"username": username, "is_admin": is_admin}
      except JWTError:
          return None
  ```
- Added the necessary imports for JWT handling to the WebRTC module
- This makes the WebRTC module self-contained without dependencies on the removed WebSocket code

### 4. Analysis of WebRTC Detection Module (Completed)

The `detection_webrtc.py` module includes several endpoints:
- `POST /detect` - Base detection endpoint used for testing
- `POST /webrtc/{camera_id}/detect/start` - Start detection on a WebRTC stream
- `POST /webrtc/{camera_id}/detect/stop` - Stop detection on a WebRTC stream
- `POST /webrtc/{camera_id}/detect/update` - Update detection parameters
- `GET /webrtc/{camera_id}/detect/status` - Get detection status

Based on the search results, these endpoints appear to be primarily for testing and development purposes rather than production use. Frontend code samples and active logs show usage of the main detection endpoints:
- `POST /api/detect?camera_id=1`
- `POST /api/detection/config`

However, the WebRTC detection module provides additional functionality that may be used in the future. Since we're preserving the WebRTC functionality, we'll keep this module in place while monitoring its actual usage in production.

## Summary of Changes

The cleanup process focused on removing deprecated WebSocket functionality while preserving the current actively used endpoints. Key actions taken:

1. **Removed WebSocket Routes**: The WebSocket routes that were replaced by WebRTC functionality have been completely removed from the active API routes.

2. **Code Preservation**: While removing the code from active use, we preserved it in an archive directory for future reference, maintaining code history.

3. **Dependency Management**: Identified and fixed dependencies on the removed code, making the remaining modules self-contained.

4. **Selective Preservation**: Retained the WebRTC detection module despite limited current usage, as it may provide useful functionality in the future.

5. **Documentation**: Created this cleanup log to document the process, decisions, and rationale.

## Current Active Endpoints

After cleanup, these are the primary active endpoints:

1. **Detection Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/detect?camera_id=1` - On-demand detection
   - `POST /api/detection/config` - Configure detection behavior

2. **Video Streaming**:
   - WebRTC endpoints (in `webrtc.py`) - For efficient video streaming

3. **Supporting Endpoints**:
   - Auth, camera management, calibration, logs, and other supporting functionality

### Next Steps:
1. Consider additional cleanup of test files in the temp directories if they are no longer needed
2. Continue monitoring usage of detection_webrtc.py to determine if it should be moved to archive in the future
